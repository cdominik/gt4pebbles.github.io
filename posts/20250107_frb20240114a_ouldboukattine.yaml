We report on the detection of 8 high-fluence bursts within 7 days originating from FRB 20240114A. FRB 20240114A was initially discovered and reported on by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration (ATel <a href='https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=16420'>#16420</a>) and has subsequently been detected and localized by a variety of other telescopes (see e.g. ATels <a href='https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=16433'>#16433</a>, <a href='https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=16434'>#16434</a>, <a href='https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=16542'>#16542</a>, <a href='https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=16446'>#16446</a>, <a href='https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=16597'>#16597</a>, <a href='https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=16599'>#16599</a>, <a href='https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=16620'>#16620</a> and references therein). <br><br>
We have been observing FRB 20240114A regularly since its discovery. Our observations between June 2024 and December 2024 add up to 600 hours and led to the detection of 7 bursts at L-band 1.4 GHz (L-band, 500h) and no detections at 330 MHz (P-band, 100h). This indicates that the source continued to be active, but at a lower activity level during this time. <br><br>
Most recently, we detected single bursts on December 30th and 31st, 2024, while detecting no bursts on January 2, 2025. On January 4, 2025 we detected 6 bursts in only 4.5 hours of observing, indicating high activity at that time. All reported bursts are detected at 1.4 GHz (L-band) and have a fluence higher than our completeness threshold of 10 Jy ms. The brightest event has a fluence of 770 +/- 150 Jy ms. We estimate the fluence by averaging over the full observing bandwidth and applying the radiometer equation using a system equivalent flux density (SEFD) of 250 Jy for Torun. The attached figure shows the dynamic spectra of three events. <br><br>
In the HyperFlash project, we carry out high-cadence observations of known (repeating) FRB sources using a set of 25 to 32-meter European radio telescopes. Our observing strategy and participating stations have previously been described in ATel <a href='https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=16565'>#16565</a> and <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024NatAs...8..337K/abstract'>Kirsten et al. 2024</a>. Observations are carried out on a best-effort basis and, whenever possible, the telescopes observe simultaneously at complementary wavelengths. <br><br>
Additionally, FRB 20240114A has also been detected by CHIME/FRB on January 1, 2025, as reported on the CHIME/FRB <a href='https://www.chime-frb.ca/repeaters'>FRB repeater webpage</a>. The detection of our high-fluence bursts within limited observing hours over the past week suggests that the source has entered a state of increased activity. We will continue to monitor FRB 20240114A using HyperFlash and encourage follow up observations at all wavelengths.
