body: We report on a non-detection of radio bursts from the soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1935+2154 with LOFAR. These LOFAR observations had the goals of i. studying the detailed morphology of the radio bursts in order to potentially compare with the characteristic time-frequency structure seen in repeating FRBs (Hessels et al. 2019) and ii. studying interstellar scattering along this line of sight.
